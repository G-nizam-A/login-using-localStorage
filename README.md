# Login-Register-using-localStorage


This set of files establishes a basic user authentication system with registration, login, and a welcome page. Users can register by providing a unique username, email, phone number, and password, with validations to ensure data integrity. The registration data is stored locally. The login page allows users to log in with their email and password, verifying credentials against the stored registration data. Upon successful login, user information is stored in local storage. The welcome page checks for a logged-in user and displays a personalized welcome message. The system uses local storage to persist user data and provides a simple way to manage user sessions on the client side.
